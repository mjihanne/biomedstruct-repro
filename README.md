\# BioMedStruct – Reproducibility Package



This repository provides a minimal and anonymized implementation of the

experimental pipeline.



Due to confidentiality constraints, real hospital maintenance data cannot

be shared. A synthetic dataset is therefore provided to illustrate the

preprocessing, model training, calibration, and validation procedures.
